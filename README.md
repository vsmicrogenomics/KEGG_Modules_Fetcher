# KEGG_Modules_Fetcher

Introduction
kegg_modules_fetcher.py is a Python script designed to extract detailed information about biological modules from the KEGG database. This script takes a list of KEGG module IDs, fetches data for each module, and extracts relevant details, including entries, symbols, names, pathway IDs, and pathway names associated with each module. It's particularly useful for bioinformatics research where detailed module information is crucial.

The script is designed to handle API rate limits by introducing a delay between requests, ensuring compliance with KEGG API usage policies.

Features
Fetches module details from KEGG database using module IDs.
Extracts entries, symbols, names, pathway IDs, and pathway names.
Handles API rate limits by introducing a delay between requests.
Outputs data in a tab-separated values (TSV) file for easy analysis.
Requirements
Python 3
requests library


Certainly! Below is an example introduction that you can use for your GitHub repository to describe the kegg_modules_fetcher.py script, including example input and output.
